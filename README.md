## Short description
----
Project Library is a web application that lets you display book cards with the book title, the author, the number of pages and wether you've read the book or not. Thats allows you to save books that you've read or display books that you still want to read. An added book can easily be removed and the information wether you've read the book or not can be changed with a click on the information.
