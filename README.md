## Short description
----
Project Library is a web application that lets you display book cards with the book title, the author, the number of pages and wether you've read the book or not. Thats allows you to save books that you've read or display books that you still want to read. An added book can easily be removed and the information wether you've read the book or not can be changed with a click on the information.

## Motivation
---
I build this project to reinforce my understanding of the newly learned object concepts in JavaScript and refresh my knowledge of DOM manipulation with JavaScript after not coding for roughly 2 months due to moving and other reasons.

## Features
---
- Adding Books with manually entered data
- Removing books from the page
- Changing the read status by clicking the status
- Form validation: only entering positive numbers will let you create a book and you must fill each input field to create a book
- closing the popup when creating a new book by clicking next to the popup window
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

## Technologies used
---
- JavaScript
- CSS3
- HTML 5
